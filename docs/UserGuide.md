## Introduction

### What is ScamBook?

ScamBook is a **desktop contact management app** optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  ScamBook allows users to track **large numbers of contacts** with flexible **user-defined** information metrics. It is equipped with features for users to **define and manipulate specific details** for each profile, offering maximum freedom to **record, filter, and sort** any detail. Plus, enjoy **ultimate security** with 100% **locally** stored data, erasable **instantly**.

### Who is ScamBook for?

ScamBook is designed for **Singapore-based investment and financial scam callers** managing a high volume of victim contacts daily. If you are a scammer who:
* is **tech-savvy** and prefer typing to clicking, and comfortable with
a command line interfaces (CLI);
* operates as a **solo caller** and need a private, single-user system to
manage your contacts;
* handles **hundreds to thousands of contacts** and need a system that can
scale to your needs;
* needs to manage and update contacts **on-the-go during live calls**;

ScamBook is the app for you!

<!-- Quickstart appropriate for target users and fit-for-purpose -->
## Quick start

<!-- Quickstart: Installation instructions -->
### Installation
1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed
   [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
   <!-- TODO: Add detailed checking/installation instructions for JDK -->

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from
   [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for
   your ScamBook.

1. Double-click on the `.jar` file to run the application. If the application does not launch,
refer to [FAQ](#Troubleshooting) for alternate ways to launch the application.

<!-- Quickstart: Overview of UI -->
### Overview
A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

![Ui](images/Ui.png) <!-- TODO: annotated screenshot of the UI -->
<small>*<center>Image credits for status icons: Downloaded from https://emoji.aranja.com/.</center>*</small>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add John Doe --phone 98765432 --email johnd@example.com --tag address:John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to ScamBook.

   * `tag 2 --add income:100000 --edit address:Tom street` : Adds the tag `income:100000` to the 2nd contact shown in the current list, and edits the `address` tag of that contact to be `Tom street`.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

<!-- Quickstart: Adding, editing, deleting, basic general workflow -->

### Basic commands

Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command, or the [Commands Summary](#commands-summary) section for a quick summary of all commands and their formats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

Upon successful execution of a command, a corresponding success message will be displayed.

The `filter` command will only display a subset of filtered profiles in ScamBook. In general, after successful execution of any command, if the modified profile(s) still fulfill the most recent filter applied, the displayed list will remain as the filtered list. Otherwise, the displayed list will revert to show all profiles.

<!-- Disclaimer for command format, applicable to all commands -->
<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. They can contain spaces and special characters (except `index`, which expects a single positive integer). <br>
  e.g. in `add NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add John Doe`.

* Items in `[square brackets]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `NAME [--phone PHONE]` can be used as `John Doe --phone 88463679` or as `John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[--tag NAME:VALUE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `--tag school:NUS`, `--tag school:NUS --tag salary:10000` etc.
  * A limit of 100 occurrences of each distinct type of multi-occurrence parameters is enforced for each command (after which behaviour is undefined). It is unlikely that this limit will ever be encountered with reasonable use.

* Mandatory parameters must come before optional parameters.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `NAME [--phone PHONE]`, `--phone 88091246 John` is not acceptable.

* Optional parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `[--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL]`, `--email john@example.com --phone 91842739` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br> e.g. if the command input is `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<!--
Command User guide format:

### Command description (within 5 words) : `command`
Short description of the command.

Format: `command [parameters]`


[Following sections are optional, include only if applicable (try to be minimal)]

<box type="warning" seamless>
Warning about the command, e.g. common mistakes, important notes, etc.
</box>


Expected output or behaviour if the command is executed successfully. Use
screenshots (properly cropped) only if necessary, e.g. if the output is too
long or contains formatting that is hard to represent in text.


Examples: [DO NOT include unrealistic examples (use realistic params.) and DO
NOT include unlikely user input (e.g., names with backslaches) if already
handled by the app.]
* `Expected input`
  Explanation of output or behaviour if needed


<box type="tip" seamless>
Tips about the command, e.g. how to use it more effectively, etc.
</box>

-->

<br>

### Constraints on input values
Emails should be of the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to the following constraints:
1. The `local-part` should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters: `+_.-`. The `local-part` may not start or end with any special characters.
2. This is followed by a `@` and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
   The domain name must:
    - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
    - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
   - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

<br>

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the ScamBook.

Format: `add NAME [--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL] [--tag TAGNAME:TAGVALUE]...`

* There is NO duplicate checking, since it is likely one might encounter multiple people with the same (first) names. Hence, ScamBook supports having multiple people with the same name.
* If multiple tag name-value pairs have the same tag name (see section on [Tag](#tagging-a-person--tag) below regarding tag name equality), the last value will be used.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

</box>

Examples:
* `add John Doe --phone 98765432 --email johnd@example.com --tag address:John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add Besty Croew --tag income:$100000 --tag bank:OCBC`


<br>

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the ScamBook.

Format: `edit INDEX [--name NAME] [--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL]`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be overwritten by the input values.

Examples:
* `edit 1 --phone 91234567 --email johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 --name Betsy Crower` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower`.


<br>

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the ScamBook.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the ScamBook.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.


<br>

### Tagging a person : `tag`

<!-- TODO: add visuals -->

A tag is a name-value pair that allows the user to record any arbitrary information so desired about a profile. This is achieved by this command, which modifies (add, edit or delete) the tags of an existing person in the ScamBook. In the image below of an example profile in the app, each blue box represents a tag-value pair capturing some useful information about the person.


<center><img src="images/example_profile_with_tags.png" alt="Example profile with tags" width="400"/></center>

<br>

Format: `tag INDEX [--add NAME:VALUE]... [--edit NAME:VALUE]... [--delete TAGNAME]...​`

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** `NAME`, `VALUE`, `TAGNAME`  must NOT contain colons (`:`). Otherwise, an error will be displayed. Users are advised not to include double dashes as well (`--`), otherwise behaviour is undefined.

</box>

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided, if not, nothing will happen upon execution (and success message will be displayed).
* Optional fields beginning with `--add` represents tags to be added to the person. The tag name must NOT already exist.
* Optional fields beginning with `--edit` represents tags to be modified of the person. The tag with the corresponding name must already exist.
* Optional fields beginning with `--delete` represents tags to be deleted. The tag with the corresponding name must already exist.

<box type="warning" seamless>
If the same tag name appears across multiple optional fields, behaviour is undefined. 2 tag names are considered equivalent if they are exactly equal character for character after removing leading and trailing whitespace.
</box>

Examples:
* `tag 10 --add school:National University of Singapore` Adds a tag with name `school` and value `National University of Singapore` to the tenth person. Note the support of spaces in the tag value.
* `tag 2 --delete age --edit monthly income:10000` Deletes an existing tag with name `age` and edits an existing tag with name `monthly income` to contain `10000` from the second person. Note the support of spaces in tag name and the flexible ordering of parameters.
* `tag 1 --add school:NUS --edit salary:10000 --delete age` Adds a tag with name `school` and value `NUS`, edits an existing tag with name `salary` to contain `10000` and deletes an existing tag with name `age` from the first person.


<br>

### Filtering the list of persons : `filter`

Filters the list of persons in the ScamBook to show only those that match the specified parameters.

Each use of `filter` replaces the current filtered view instead of further narrowing the existing one. To clear the current filter and show all persons again, use `filter` with no parameters.

Format: `filter [--name NAME]... [--phone PHONE]... [--email EMAIL]... [--status STATUS]... [--tag TAGNAME[:TAGVALUE]]...`

* Multiple values of the same parameter type are combined using OR.
  e.g. `--name John --name Jane` matches persons whose name contains `John` or `Jane`.
* Different parameter types are combined using AND.
  e.g. `--name John --phone 9876` matches only persons whose name contains `John` and whose phone number contains `9876`.
* `NAME`, `EMAIL`, and `TAGVALUE` are matched by case-insensitive partial match.
* `PHONE` is matched by partial match.
* `STATUS` must be one of `NONE`, `TARGET`, `SCAM`, or `IGNORE`.
* `--tag job` matches persons with a tag named `job`, while `--tag job:manager` matches persons with a `job` tag whose value contains `manager`.
* Multiple tag filters are combined using AND.

Examples:
* `filter --name John`
  Shows all persons whose name contains `John`.
* `filter --name John --name Jane`
  Shows all persons whose name contains `John` or `Jane`.
* `filter --status TARGET --status SCAM`
  Shows all persons whose status is either `TARGET` or `SCAM`.
* `filter --phone 9876 --email gmail.com`
  Shows all persons whose phone number contains `9876` **and** whose email contains `gmail.com`.
* `filter --tag job`
  Shows all persons who have a tag named `job`, regardless of its value.
* `filter --tag job:manager --tag region:west`
  Shows all persons who have both a `job` tag containing `manager` and a `region` tag containing `west`.
* `filter --name Tan --status TARGET --tag source:telegram`
  Shows all persons whose name contains `Tan`, whose status is `TARGET`, and whose `source` tag contains `telegram`.

<box type="tip" seamless>
The `filter` command changes the displayed list of persons, and other commands will refer to the index of the currently displayed list.
</box>


<br>

### Sorting the list of persons : `sort`

Sorts the current list of persons by a specified field.

Format: `sort [FIELD] [--asc|--desc] [--number|--alpha]`

* `FIELD` can be `name`, `phone`, `email`, or a tag name (e.g., `income`). Defaults to `name` if omitted.
* `--asc` sorts in ascending order (default), `--desc` sorts in descending order.
* `--number` sorts numerically where possible (default), `--alpha` sorts alphabetically.
* Entries with missing values for the specified field are placed at the end.

Examples:
* `sort` Sorts by name in ascending order.
* `sort phone --desc --number` Sorts by phone number in descending numeric order.
* `sort income --alpha` Sorts by the `income` tag alphabetically.


<br>

### Marking person status: `clearstatus`, `target`, `scam`, or `ignore`

Sets the status of a specific person. We currently support 4 common statuses, each represented by its corresponding command name. Referring the image below (same image as in the [Overview](#overview) section, reproduced here for convenience), the emoji of each profile represents its status, as set by the four commands, in order.
1. No status, via `clearstatus`.
2. A potential target, via `target`.
3. Already scammed, via `scam`.
4. To be ignored, via `ignore`.

![Example screenshot of status commands](images/status_command.png)

Format: `status_command INDEX`

* `status_command` should be replaced by either one of `clearstatus`, `target`, `scam`, or `ignore`.
* Sets the status of the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The new status overwrites any previously existing status, i.e. each person can have exactly 1 status at any time (no status is also a status).
* Setting a particular status for a person that already has the corresponding status will do nothing (and success message will be displayed).
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `scam 2` marks the second person to have been scammed.
* `ignore 4` marks the fourth person to be ignored (e.g. if you think the fourth person is unlikely to be a victim and you should not pursue this further).
* `target 3` marks the third person as a potential target.
* `clearstatus 1` clears the first person of any indicated status.


<br>

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the ScamBook.

Format: `list`


<br>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the ScamBook.

Format: `clear`


<br>

### Deleting the app and all data: `nuke`

Deletes the app and the data file containing victim profiles.

Format: `nuke`

<box type="important" seamless>
<b>Caution</b>: This action is irreversible. Use with caution.
</box>


<br>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a pop-up window explaining how to use the basic commands. For more details on how to use this
application, you can also click on **Copy URL** to access the user guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


<br>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`




<br>

### Saving the data

ScamBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


<br>

### Editing the data file

ScamBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ScamBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ScamBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

<!-- Upcoming features -->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Future work
1. The current tag name equality checking is done by checking string equality. In the future, we plan to add more equality checking semantics, to guard against accidental typos from users. In particular, we will incorporate case insensitivity and flexible whitespace (consecutive spaces will be treated as one). For example, `area code` and `Area code` will be treated as equal tag names, and hence disallowed in commands requiring unique tag names (with more friendly error messages suggesting a typo was made). On the other hand, `Area code` can be used to edit the tag of `area code` of an existing person, providing more convenience.

2. The current format for command parameters uses double dashes (`--`), i.e. long options. This design choice was made because it ensures greater clarity in command formats, and also allows greater convenience in input values (single dashes can be used freely without having to escape it). Future work will support abbreviations, i.e. single dashes (`-`), just like command line applications, for greater convenience for experienced users.

3. Currently, all data has to be either manually added via the commands, or by editing the `json` data file. Future work will support more mechanisms for data importation, such as reading directly from a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file.

4. A scammer might have different personas when operating, such as pretending to be personnel from different banks. A possible future direction is to allow users to create multiple sets of ScamBooks, each with their own separate details, so every distinct persona can have its own list of contacts.

5. Another significant area for future implementation is better integer parsing. Currently, tag values are parsed as is, so values such as `$100000` and `$200,000` are not recognised as numbers. This feature will allow more flexible interpretation of numbers, allowing the `sort` command to work on tags such as `savings: $1,000,000`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

### Troubleshooting
**Q:** I encounter an error when I double-click on the `.jar` file to run the application.<br>
**A:** Open a terminal window at the location of the application. This can be done by right-clicking on the file explorer, as shown in the image below, then clicking on the button `Open in Terminal`. (The image is for Windows, other operating systems have a similar feature). Type the following command: `java -jar <name of the jar file>`. In the example of the image below, this would be `java -jar ScamBook-v1.4.jar`.

![Example screenshot in Windows of how to open terminal](images/HowToOpenTerminal.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

3. `nuke` command does not delete the application on Windows OS, due to a limitation of the OS disabling deletion by the app itself.
