## Introduction

### What is ScamBook?

ScamBook is a **desktop contact management app** optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  ScamBook allows users to track **large numbers of contacts** with flexible **user-defined** information metrics. It is equipped with features for users to **define and manipulate specific details** for each profile, offering maximum freedom to **record, filter, and sort** any detail. Plus, enjoy **ultimate security** with 100% **locally** stored data, erasable **instantly**.

### Who is ScamBook for?

ScamBook is designed for **Singapore-based investment and financial scam callers** managing a high volume of victim contacts daily. If you are a scammer who:
* is **tech-savvy** and prefer typing to clicking, and comfortable with
  command line interfaces (CLI);
* operates as a **solo caller** and need a private, single-user system to
  manage your contacts;
* handles **hundreds to thousands of contacts** and need a system that can
  scale to your needs;
* needs to manage and update contacts **on-the-go during live calls**;

ScamBook is the app for you!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- Quickstart appropriate for target users and fit-for-purpose -->
## Quick start

<!-- Quickstart: Installation instructions -->
### Installation
1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version found
   [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from
   [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for
   your ScamBook.

1. Double-click on the `.jar` file to run the application. If the application does not launch,
refer to [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for alternate ways to launch the application.

<!-- Quickstart: Overview of UI -->
### Overview
A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. The app contains some sample data for you to use.<br>

![Ui](images/Ui.png)
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic">
    <small>Image credits for status icons: Downloaded from https://emoji.aranja.com/.</small>
</div>
<br>
The top part of the application is the contact list - you can view contacts there.

The box at the bottom that reads "Enter command here..." is where you enter commands. This is where you get to interact with ScamBook!

### Entering a Command

Suppose our contact list has 6 people in it. This example will show how to add a 7th contact.

We can use the `add` command to create a new contact. In the box at the bottom, type `add`.

![AddExample2.png](images/AddExample1.png)

Upon typing `add`, the format for the rest of the command will appear.
The command's format is `add NAME [--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL] [--tag NAME:VALUE]...`.

Each command's format is given as a sequence of compulsory parameters, and optional parameters denoted in square brackets `[]`.
In this command, `NAME` is a compulsory parameter, while phone, email and tags are optional parameters.

Suppose we want to add a contact with the following information:
- Name: John Doe
- Phone: 88463679
- Extra information:
    - Job: teacher

We can enter the command `add John Doe --phone 88463679 --tag job:teacher` and press enter.

![AddExample3.png](images/AddExample2.png)

We can see that we have created a new contact John Doe.

To understand more about how to interpret the command formats, refer to [Command Format Information](#command-format-information).

Refer to the [Command List](#commands) below for details of each command, or the [Commands Summary](#commands-summary) section for a quick summary of all commands and their formats.

<!-- Disclaimer for command format, applicable to all commands -->
<box type="info" seamless>

## Command Format Information

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. They can contain spaces and special characters (except `INDEX`, which expects a single positive integer). <br>
  e.g. in `add NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add John Doe`.

* Parameters in `[square brackets]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `NAME [--phone PHONE]` can be used as `John Doe --phone 88463679` or as `John Doe`.

* The Parameter `INDEX` refers to the number on the left side of the address book.
    * For example, the delete command has the format `delete INDEX`. If we type `delete 4`, ScamBook will delete David Li's entry in the below example:
      ![DeleteExample.png](images/DeleteExample.png)

<br>

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[--tag NAME:VALUE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `--tag school:NUS`, `--tag school:NUS --tag salary:10000` etc.
    * For each parameter that can be used multiple times, each command should contain up to 100 of such parameters.
    * In the above example of `[--tag NAME:VALUE]…​`, the command should have up to 100 occurrences of `--tag`. Above this, the behaviour is undefined.

* Mandatory parameters must come before optional parameters.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `NAME [--phone PHONE]`, `--phone 88091246 John` is not acceptable.

* Optional parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `[--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL]`, `--email john@example.com --phone 91842739` is also acceptable.


* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Commands

### Viewing command history

Similar to the command line interface of a terminal, you can use the up and down arrow keys to view your command history. This allows you to easily reuse or modify previous commands without having to retype them.


<br>

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the ScamBook.

Format: `add NAME [--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL] [--tag TAGNAME:TAGVALUE]...`

* Duplicate names are allowed, since it is likely one might encounter multiple people with the same (first) names. Hence, ScamBook supports having multiple people with the same name.
* If multiple tag name-value pairs have the same tag name (see section on [Tag](#tagging-a-person--tag) below regarding tag name equality), the last value will be used.

<box type="tip" seamless>
<b>Tip:</b> A person can have any number of tags (including 0).
</box>

Examples:
* `add John Doe --phone 98765432 --email johnd@example.com --tag address:John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add Betsy Crower --tag income:$100000 --tag bank:OCBC`


<br>

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person's name, phone number or email. For editing tags, see the [Tag Command](#tagging-a-person--tag).

Format: `edit INDEX [--name NAME] [--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL]`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be overwritten by the input values.

Examples:
* `edit 1 --phone 91234567 --email johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 --name Betsy Crower` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower`.


<br>

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the ScamBook.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.


Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the ScamBook.
* `filter --name Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `filter` command.


<br>

### Tagging a person : `tag`

A tag is a name-value pair that allows the user to record any arbitrary information so desired about a profile. This is achieved by this command, which modifies (add, edit or delete) the tags of an existing person in the ScamBook. In the image below of an example profile in the app, each blue box represents a tag-value pair capturing some useful information about the person.


<center><img src="images/example_profile_with_tags.png" alt="Example profile with tags" width="400"/></center>

<br>

Format: `tag INDEX [--add NAME:VALUE]... [--edit NAME:VALUE]... [--delete TAGNAME]...​`

<box type="warning" seamless>
<b>Caution:</b> <code>NAME</code>, <code>VALUE</code>, <code>TAGNAME</code> must NOT contain colons (<code>:</code>). Otherwise, an error will be displayed. Users are advised not to use <code>--</code> as part of the tag name or tag value, as this may lead to undefined behaviour.
</box>

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided, if not, nothing will happen upon execution (and success message will be displayed).
* Optional fields beginning with `--add` represent tags to be added to the person. The tag name must NOT already exist.
* Optional fields beginning with `--edit` represent tags to be modified of the person. The tag with the corresponding name must already exist.
* Optional fields beginning with `--delete` represent tags to be deleted. The tag with the corresponding name must already exist.

<box type="warning" seamless>
If the same tag name appears across multiple optional fields, behaviour is undefined. 2 tag names are considered equivalent if they are exactly equal character for character after removing leading and trailing whitespace.
</box>

Examples:
* `tag 10 --add school:National University of Singapore` Adds a tag with name `school` and value `National University of Singapore` to the tenth person. Note the support of spaces in the tag value.
* `tag 2 --delete age --edit monthly income:10000` Deletes an existing tag with name `age` and edits an existing tag with name `monthly income` to contain `10000` from the second person. Note the support of spaces in tag name and the flexible ordering of parameters.
* `tag 1 --add school:NUS --edit salary:10000 --delete age` Adds a tag with name `school` and value `NUS`, edits an existing tag with name `salary` to contain `10000` and deletes an existing tag with name `age` from the first person.


<br>

### Filtering the list of persons : `filter`

Filters the list of persons in the ScamBook to show only those that match the specified parameters.

Each use of `filter` replaces the current filtered view instead of further narrowing the existing one. To clear the current filter and show all persons again, use `filter` with no parameters.

Format: `filter [--name NAME]... [--phone PHONE]... [--email EMAIL]... [--status STATUS]... [--tag TAGNAME[:TAGVALUE]]...`

- Across different parameters, profiles match all conditions.
  e.g. `--name John --phone 9876` matches only persons whose name contains `John` and whose phone number contains `9876`.
- With repeated `--name`, `--phone`, `--email`, or `--status`, profiles match any of the specified values.
  e.g. `--name John --name Jane` matches persons whose name contains `John` or `Jane`.
- `NAME`, `EMAIL`, and `PHONE` conditions require case-insensitive partial match.
- `STATUS` must be one of `NONE`, `TARGET`, `SCAM`, or `IGNORE` (case-insensitive).
- `--tag TAGNAME` checks whether a person has a tag with that name.
- `--tag TAGNAME:TAGVALUE` checks whether a person has a tag with that name whose value contains `TAGVALUE`.
- `TAGNAME` requires the exact tag name (case-insensitive), while `TAGVALUE` only requires partial match (case-insensitive).
- With repeated `--tag` filters with the same tag name, profiles match any of the specified values.
- For `--tag` filters with different tag names, profiles must match all conditions.

Examples:

- `filter --name John`
  Shows all persons whose name contains `John`.
- `filter --name John --name Jane`
  Shows all persons whose name contains `John` or `Jane`.
- `filter --status TARGET --status SCAM`
  Shows all persons whose status is either `TARGET` or `SCAM`.
- `filter --phone 9876 --email gmail.com`
  Shows all persons whose phone number contains `9876` and whose email contains `gmail.com`.
- `filter --tag job`
  Shows all persons who have a tag named `job`, regardless of its value.
- `filter --tag job:manager --tag job:director`
  Shows all persons whose `job` tag contains `manager` or `director`.
- `filter --tag job --tag region:west`
  Shows all persons who have a tag named `job` (regardless of its value), and whose`region` tag contains `west`.
- `filter --tag job:manager --tag region:west`
  Shows all persons whose `job` tag contains `manager` and whose `region` tag contains `west`.
- `filter --name Tan --status TARGET --tag source:telegram`
  Shows all persons whose name contains `Tan`, whose status is `TARGET`, and whose `source` tag contains `telegram`.

<box type="tip" seamless>
The filter command affects the indices of the contacts. When using commands that take in <code>INDEX</code> as a parameter, note the index seen on the list.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>
When after running another command (e.g. <code>edit</code>),
if the modified person(s) still fulfill the most recent filter applied, the displayed list will remain as the filtered list. Otherwise, the displayed list will revert to show all persons.
</box>


<br>

### Sorting the list of persons : `sort`

Sorts the current list of persons by a specified field.

Format: `sort [FIELD] [--asc|--desc] [--number|--alpha]`

* `FIELD` can be `name`, `phone`, `email`, or a tag name (e.g., `income`). Defaults to `name` if omitted.
* `--asc` sorts in ascending order (default), `--desc` sorts in descending order.
* `--number` sorts numerically where possible (default), `--alpha` sorts alphabetically.
* Entries with missing values for the specified field are placed at the end.

Examples:
* `sort` Sorts by name in ascending order.
* `sort phone --desc --number` Sorts by phone number in descending numeric order.
* `sort income --alpha` Sorts by the `income` tag alphabetically.


<br>

### Marking person status: `clearstatus`, `target`, `scam`, or `ignore`

Sets the status of a specific person. We currently support 4 common statuses, each represented by its corresponding command name. Referring the image below (same image as in the [Overview](#overview) section, reproduced here for convenience), the emoji of each profile represents its status, as set by the four commands, in order.
1. No status, via `clearstatus`.
2. A potential target, via `target`.
3. Already scammed, via `scam`.
4. To be ignored, via `ignore`.

![Example screenshot of status commands](images/status_command.png)

In the above image, the people have the status of no status, `target`, `scam`, and `ignore`  respectively.

* `status_command` should be replaced by either one of `clearstatus`, `target`, `scam`, or `ignore`.
* Sets the status of the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The new status overwrites any previously existing status, i.e. each person can have exactly 1 status at any time (no status is also a status).
* Setting a particular status for a person that already has the corresponding status will do nothing (and success message will be displayed).


Examples:
* `clearstatus 1` clears the first person of any indicated status.
* `target 2` marks the second person as a potential target.
* `scam 3` marks the third person to have been scammed.
* `ignore 4` marks the fourth person to be ignored (e.g. if you think the fourth person is unlikely to be a victim and you should not pursue this further).

<br>

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of ALL persons in the ScamBook. This command can be used after `sort` or `filter` to revert ScamBook to its original state.

Format: `list`

<br>

### Clearing all persons : `clear`

Clears all persons from the ScamBook.

Format: `clear`

<box type="warning" seamless>
<b>Caution:</b> This action is irreversible. Use with caution.
</box>

<br>

### Deleting the app and all data: `nuke`

Deletes local data and the app JAR, then exits.

Format: `nuke`

* `nuke` does not accept any additional arguments.
* Deletes `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.
* Deletes `[JAR file location]/data/` only if the folder is empty after deleting `addressbook.json`.
* Attempts to delete the running application JAR file.

<box type="warning" seamless>
<b>Caution:</b> This action is irreversible. Use with caution.
</box>


<br>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a pop-up window explaining how to use the basic commands. For more details on how to use this
application, you can also click on **Copy URL** to access the user guide.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


<br>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------

### Constraints on input values

#### Name Constraints

Names can contain any alphanumeric characters, spaces, and the following special characters <code>,.()\`'/\-</code>.

Names should also contain at least one character

#### Phone Constraints

Phones should be a number between 3 and 20 digits in length. It should not contain spaces, or the `+` sign.

#### Email Constraints
Emails should be of the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to the following constraints:
1. The `local-part` must be either:
   - unquoted: lowercase alphanumeric characters and these special characters: <code>!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-</code>, with single periods allowed between segments only
   - quoted: enclosed in double quotes, with escaped ASCII characters allowed
2. This is followed by `@` and then a domain, which must be either:
   - a standard domain name made up of labels separated by periods, where each label starts and ends with a lowercase alphanumeric character and may contain hyphens in between
   - a bracketed domain-literal (for example, an IPv4 address like `[192.168.0.1]`)
3. Spaces are not allowed.

<box type="tip" seamless>
<b>Tip:</b> <code>filter --email</code> accepts any non-empty substring for matching and does not require a full valid email format.
</box>


<br>

---------------------------------------------------

### Saving the data

ScamBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


<br>

### Editing the data file

ScamBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>
<b>Caution:</b>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ScamBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ScamBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

<br>

---------------------------------------------------

### Autoscroll
- After making modifications to a contact, the app will scroll to and select the relevant contact. This behaviour
  occurs for these commands: `add`, `edit`, `tag`, `clearstatus`, `target`, `scam`, `ignore`.
- For these commands, the app will scroll to and select the first contact in the address book: `filter`, `sort`, `list`.

![Autoscroll example](images/AutoscrollExample.png)

<br>

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

### Troubleshooting

**Q**: My application does not launch when double-clicking on it. What should I do? <br>
**A**: The most reliable alternative is to launch it via the command line. To do so, navigate to the folder that
you have placed ScamBook in. Right click and open a terminal there.

![HowToOpenTerminal.png](images/HowToOpenTerminal.png)

From the terminal, type `java -jar <filename>.jar`. In the above example, you can type `java -jar ScamBook-v1.4.jar`
and press enter. This will launch the application.

On a Mac, if the option to open a terminal at the folder does not exist, refer to [this video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsI4Iast978) to enable the option.

**Q**: When I opened ScamBook, my previous session's changes weren't saved. Why? <br>
**A**: If ScamBook is in a write-protected folder, the program cannot save your data. Try checking your folder's properties, or moving ScamBook to another location.

### Miscellaneous

**Q**: I have a question that is not answered here. Where can I ask it?<br>
**A**: You can ask your question by creating a new issue in the [ScamBook
repository](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/issues).

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Future work
1. The current tag name equality checking is done by checking string equality. In the future, we plan to add more equality checking semantics, to guard against accidental typos from users. In particular, we will incorporate case insensitivity and flexible whitespace (consecutive spaces will be treated as one). For example, `area code` and `Area code` will be treated as equal tag names, and hence disallowed in commands requiring unique tag names (with more friendly error messages suggesting a typo was made). On the other hand, `Area code` can be used to edit the tag of `area code` of an existing person, providing more convenience.

2. The current format for command parameters uses double dashes (`--`), i.e. long options. This design choice was made because it ensures greater clarity in command formats, and also allows greater convenience in input values (single dashes can be used freely without having to escape it). Future work will support abbreviations, i.e. single dashes (`-`), just like command line applications, for greater convenience for experienced users.

3. Currently, all data has to be either manually added via the commands, or by editing the `json` data file. Future work will support more mechanisms for data importation, such as reading directly from a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file.

4. A scammer might have different personas when operating, such as pretending to be personnel from different banks. A possible future direction is to allow users to create multiple sets of ScamBooks, each with their own separate details, so every distinct persona can have its own list of contacts.

5. Another significant area for future implementation is better integer parsing. Currently, tag values are parsed as is, so values such as `$100000` and `$200,000` are not recognised as numbers. This feature will allow more flexible interpretation of numbers, allowing the `sort` command to work on tags such as `savings: $1,000,000`.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

3. On Windows OS, `nuke` may fail to delete the running application JAR due to file locking by the OS.
