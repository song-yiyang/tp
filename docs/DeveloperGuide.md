## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Below is a class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

When `Logic` is called to execute a command, the following happens:

1. The command is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object. It checks the first word of the command (known as the **command word**), and based on that, creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., DeleteCommandParser) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

#### Parsing & Input Patterns

The following is a (partial) class diagram for the parser

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

Each `Parser` contains an `InputPattern`, which is a specification for the pattern of arguments & parameters this command accepts.

An `InputPattern` consists of a list of `Token` and a list of `Param`.

The list of `Token` represents the compulsory arguments that come after the command word. The list of tokens is ordered.
Different Tokens accept different inputs, such as `String`s, `Integer`s, etc.

The list of `Param` represents optional arguments that come after the compulsory argument. 
These are specified by a param id starting with `--`. These can be provided in any order.


For example, the `add` command has the following format `add NAME [--phone PHONE] [--email EMAIL] [--tag NAME:VALUE]...`. 
The command has one `Token`: which takes in the name. It also has 3 `Param`, which represent the phone, email and tag respectively.

Note that `Param` has the functionality to specify how many times it can appear in a valid input. 
In this case, `--phone` and `--email` can appear between 0 and 1 times, while `--tag` can appear between 0 and 100 times.
### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the ScamBook data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ScamBook data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Input Pattern Parsing

Once the command is received, we denote `args` as the string that comes after the command word.

Subsequently, we find the first occurrence of a `Param` id. For example, in the `add` command,
we find the first occurrence of `--phone`, `--email` or `--tag` as these are the 3 `Param` it accepts.

If nothing is found, then it is assumed that the entire input contains zero params. From the first occurrence,
we split the `args` into `tokenArgs` and `paramArgs`. These are then parsed separately.

For `tokenArgs`, we split it into a number of segments by spaces.
Each `Token` has a function `allowSpaces` which specifies if it allows spaces or not. 
For each token in order, if it does not allow spaces, we assign it to the next segment. 
If it allows spaces, we find the first segment that matches the next token, and then assign segments in between to this token.

If during the assigning there are too many or too few tokens, or if any segment does not match
the requirements of a token, a `ParseException` is thrown.

Note: tokens that allow spaces can lead to ambiguous parsing. It is advised to keep such tokens as the very last token in general.
In particular, avoid two tokens that allow spaces beside each other.

For the `paramArgs`, they are split by the string `<space>--` and then assigned one by one.
If a `--` does not match the id of any Params, a `ParseException` is thrown.

### Sort feature

The sort mechanism allows users to sort the person list by various fields (name, phone, email, or tag values) in ascending or descending order, with support for numeric or alphabetic comparison modes.
Note that the `sort` command does NOT use the input pattern methods as mentioned above, since its parameter values are different.

#### Implementation

The sort feature is implemented through the following key classes:
* `SortCommandParser` — Parses user input and creates a `SortSpec` containing the sort parameters
* `SortCommand` — Builds a `Comparator<Person>` and applies it to the model
* `SortSpec` — Value object encapsulating sort parameters (target field, order, mode)

The following sequence diagram shows how a sort operation is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram" />

How the sort command works:

1. The user issues a sort command (e.g., `sort phone --desc`).
2. `SortCommandParser` parses the arguments and creates a `SortSpec` with the target field (`PHONE`), order (`DESC`), and mode (`NUMBER` by default).
3. `SortCommand` is created with the `SortSpec` and executed.
4. During execution, `SortCommand` builds a `Comparator<Person>` based on the `SortSpec`.
5. The comparator is applied to the view via `Model#updateSortedPersonList()`.
6. The `list` command resets both the filter and the sort order via `Model#resetSortedPersonList()`, restoring the original insertion order.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How sort handles null/missing values:**

* **Current choice:** Nulls always sort last, regardless of ascending/descending order.
    * Pros: Predictable behavior; missing data doesn't clutter results.
    * Cons: Less flexible for users who want nulls first.

**Aspect: View-only sorting:**

* **Current choice:** Sort only affects the view layer (`SortedList`), not the underlying data.
    * Pros: Original insertion order is preserved and can be restored with `list` command.
    * Cons: Sort order does not persist across sessions.

### Help Window

The help text displayed in the help window is generated dynamically using `CommandRegistry`, which serves as
a central registry of all commands supported by the application. Each command is registered as a `CommandInfo`
object, which holds the command's name, description, and an optional example string.

#### Implementation

`CommandRegistry` stores commands in a `LinkedHashMap`, preserving insertion order so that commands appear
in the help text in a consistent, developer-defined sequence. It is a non-instantiable utility class accessed
statically, initialized once via a `static` block at class load time.

`CommandInfo` wraps three fields:
* `name` — the command word (e.g. `add`, `delete`)
* `description` — the expected argument format (e.g. `INDEX [--name NAME]...`)
* `example` — an optional usage example shown below the description

When the help window is opened, `HelpWindow#buildHelpText()` iterates over `CommandRegistry#getCommands()`
and formats each entry into a fixed-width table, aligning descriptions by padding command names to the
width of the longest registered command. Examples, if present, are indented and prefixed with `e.g.`.

This design means that adding a new command to the registry automatically propagates it to the help window
without any changes to `HelpWindow` itself.

`CommandRegistry` also supports the command tooltip feature — when a user types a partial command in the
command box, `CommandRegistry#getCommandInfo(commandName)` is called to retrieve the corresponding
`CommandInfo` and display its format as a tooltip (see [Entering a Command](UserGuide.md#entering-a-command) in the User Guide).

<puml src="diagrams/CommandRegistryClassDiagram.puml" width="280" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How commands are registered:**

* **Current choice:** Commands are registered statically in `CommandRegistry` via a `static` block.
    * Pros: Simple, centralized, and ordered. Easy to see all supported commands at a glance.
    * Cons: Adding a new command requires manually updating `CommandRegistry` in addition to implementing the command itself.

* **Alternative:** Each command self-registers by calling `CommandRegistry.register()` in its own static block.
    * Pros: Keeps registration co-located with the command implementation.
    * Cons: Registration order becomes non-deterministic, and commands that are never referenced may not register at all.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _[mainstream OS](#glossary)_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 200 victims without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using a traditional mouse-based Graphical User Interface.
4. Should be fully functional without an internet connection.
5. Should accept only ASCII characters in user input, and display all stored information in ASCII characters.

<br>

### Glossary

* **Victim Profile**: A contact entry representing a potential scam target, containing name, phone, email and custom tags
* **Tag**: A key-value pair of information attached to a victim profile, e.g., `job:investment banker`, `yearly income:$100000`
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

Please follow the setup instructions in the [user guide](UserGuide.html#installation) to install and run the app. Assuming no commands have been entered yet, and that the default sample data is loaded, here is a list of commands one could follow, which emulates a realistic scenario of using the app that uses (almost) all commands. All commands should be successful and should result in a success message displayed.
1. `help`
2. `add Bernado --phone 87019942 --tag job:manager`
3. `edit 4 --email davidli@u.nus.edu`
4. `delete 6`
5. `tag 3 --add monthly income:12000 --edit children:5 --delete language`
6. `scam 1`
7. `ignore 2`
8. `clearstatus 3`
9. `filter --tag job:manager`
10. `sort monthly income`
11. `target 2`
12. `list`
13. `clear`
14. `exit`

## **Appendix: Planned enhancements**

Team size: 5 people

1. **Improve code quality for `sort` command:** The sort command parser does not use the existing `InputPattern` system used by all other commands that have any arguments, as it has somewhat distinct syntax. For improving code quality, we plan to make `InputPattern` more flexible to accommodate the `sort` command's syntax, and future commands that may have more varied syntax.

2. **Allow `edit` command to clear name, phone and email fields:** Currently, the `edit` command requires the edited name, phone, or email to be another valid value, and the empty string is always invalid. However, there may be use cases when the user wishes to mark one of name, phone or email as null or empty. We plan to add this functionality, for example by allowing users to input `--phone ""` to clear the phone field.
